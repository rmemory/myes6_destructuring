Destructuring is a way to extract data from arrays (iterables), objects, maps, and sets,
into their own variables.

Destructuring from an object uses curly brackets {}, while destructuring from an array
uses square brackets []

Start with index.html. Those are all object destructuring examples
Next move to destructuring_with_arrays.html.
